# MyFormaterApplication

The goal of this exercise is to refactor MyFormaterApplication.

### Instructions

1/ First, provide the missing implementation for:
* public static String getType(String s)
* public static String getContent(String s)
* public static String formatAType(String s)
* public static String formatDefaultType(String s)

MyFormaterApplicationTest class must run successfully

2/ Then, refactor MyApplication using at least:
* Spring
* Design patterns when needed
* Unit Tests

### Delivery
The delivery includes a private GIT repository. The sources should be documented, tested and ready to deliver in producCon (clean and without useless code).
Think about the code readability (style, structure and comments) and add tests to cover edge cases.
